# ULF-EnC-Challenge
ULF-EnC: Ultra-Low-Field MRI Image Enhancement Challenge

📌 Project Overview

The ULF-EnC Challenge is designed to advance deep learning techniques for enhancing ultra-low-field (64mT) MRI to match high-field (3T) MRI quality. This challenge provides a paired dataset of 3T and 64mT MRI scans and aims to push the boundaries of medical image enhancement by encouraging participants to develop robust algorithms that improve diagnostic capabilities.

🏆 Challenge Goals

Develop deep learning models to enhance 64mT MRI images.

Maintain anatomical integrity and clinical relevance.

Submissions are benchmarked using a weighted combination of SSIM, PSNR, MAE, and NMSE, with SSIM contributing the most to the final ranking to emphasize structural fidelity.

Promote accessibility to high-quality MRI in low-resource settings.

## 🖥️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed, then run the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy nibabel pandas scikit-image
```

### 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BioMedAnalysis/ULF-EnC-Challenge.git
cd ULF-EnC-Challenge
```

### 🧪 Generate Dummy Data

```bash
python generate_dummy_data.py
```

### ✅ Run Evaluation

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

### 📊 View Leaderboard

```bash
cat leaderboard.csv
```

📊 Evaluation Process

Submissions are evaluated per subject and per modality.

Two metrics are used:

Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)

Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Normalised Mean Square Error (NMSE)

Leaderboard ranks teams based on a weighted combination of SSIM (70%), PSNR (10%), MAE (10%), and NMSE (10%) is used to evaluate reconstruction quality, emphasizing structural fidelity while incorporating intensity-based and error-based metrics.

Results are stored in leaderboard.csv.

## 🚀 Submission Guidelines

### 🔹 File Naming

Each team must submit enhanced MRI images using the following naming format:

```
subject_{ID}_enhanced_{MODALITY}.nii.gz
```

**Examples:**

```
subject_1_enhanced_T1.nii.gz  
subject_1_enhanced_T2.nii.gz  
subject_1_enhanced_FLAIR.nii.gz  
```

**Expected Directory Structure:**

```
submissions/
└── team_name/
    ├── subject_1_enhanced_T1.nii.gz
    ├── subject_1_enhanced_T2.nii.gz
    ├── subject_1_enhanced_FLAIR.nii.gz
    ├── ...
```
### ✅ Validation Folder Structure

```
📁 validation/
├── 📁 POCEMR001/
│   └── 📁 Enhanced/
│       ├── POCEMR001_T1.nii.gz
│       ├── POCEMR001_T2.nii.gz
│       └── POCEMR001_FLAIR.nii.gz
├── 📁 POCEMR002/
│   └── 📁 Enhanced/
│       ├── POCEMR002_T1.nii.gz
│       ├── POCEMR002_T2.nii.gz
│       └── POCEMR002_FLAIR.nii.gz
├── 📁 POCEMR003/
│   └── 📁 Enhanced/
│       ├── POCEMR003_T1.nii.gz
│       ├── POCEMR003_T2.nii.gz
│       └── POCEMR003_FLAIR.nii.gz
...
```
### 🔹 Naming Convention
- Each subject folder is named after the subject ID (e.g., POCEMR001)

- Inside each subject folder, an Enhanced/ subfolder contains multi-contrast 3D NIfTI files

- File naming format:
SUBJECTID_CONTRAST.nii.gz
Example: POCEMR001_T1.nii.gz, POCEMR001_FLAIR.nii.gz

### 🔹 Submission Format

- All reconstructed images must be submitted in **`.nii.gz`** format.
- Each team must upload a **Docker image** containing their trained model.
- The submission should produce **3D reconstructions** for each test subject.
