ULF-EnC: Ultra-Low-Field MRI Image Enhancement Challenge

📌 Project Overview

The ULF-EnC Challenge is designed to advance deep learning techniques for enhancing ultra-low-field (64mT) MRI to match high-field (3T) MRI quality. This challenge provides a paired dataset of 3T and 64mT MRI scans and aims to push the boundaries of medical image enhancement by encouraging participants to develop robust algorithms that improve diagnostic capabilities.

🏆 Challenge Goals

Develop deep learning models to enhance 64mT MRI images.

Maintain anatomical integrity and clinical relevance.

Benchmark solutions using SSIM and PSNR metrics.

Promote accessibility to high-quality MRI in low-resource settings.
